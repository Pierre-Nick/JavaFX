# JavaFX GUI's

Purpose of this REPO is mainly for fun. Building GUI's is pretty nifty with JavaFX, so I use this for making small things for my UI course that eventually turn into much bigger tasks. Of course all the source code is not up just to avoid classmates cherry-picking me sauce code eerrrrrr!
